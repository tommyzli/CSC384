1. Don't make your heuristics too computationally costly. Otherwise the accuracy
gained isn't worth the drop in speed.

2. Look for worst-case/deadlock situations and make the heuristic punish them.

3. Use sets rather than lists when you don't need to access specific items. They
are much faster for checking membership.
