1. Don't make your heuristics too computationally costly. Otherwise the accuracy
gained isn't worth the drop in speed.

2. Look for worst-case/deadlock situations and make the heuristic punish them.

3. Use sets rather than lists when you don't need to access specific items. They
are much faster for checking membership.

4. Don't return the same high value for each worst-case/deadlock situation. The return value
should depend on just 'how' bad the state is

5. Cache outputs of expensive operations. Not needing to recompute certain variables saves
a lot of processing time.
